      "   Thought: The user is asking about future AI developments in 2025. This is a general knowledge and predictive query. I have no information gathered yet. The best tool to find information about current events, news, and future trends is the web search tool. The other tools (CRYPTO, STOCK, FINANCE_TRACKER, RAG) are not relevant to this topic. Therefore, I should use CALL_SEARCH to find the requested information.\n",
      "   Action: SEARCH\n",
      "   Justification: This action is the most appropriate for finding information on future technological trends and developments like those anticipated for AI in 2025.\n",

      "   I couldn't find any results for \"latest AI developments in 2025.\" Since 2025 is in the future, there are no \"developments\" yet. I can search for predictions or trends for AI in 2025 if you'd like.\n",
      "\n",
      "💭 Step 2: Reasoning\n",
      "   Thought: The initial search for \"latest AI developments in 2025\" failed because 2025 is in the future. The SEARCH agent correctly pointed this out and suggested a better query: searching for \"predictions or trends for AI in 2025\". To answer the user's underlying question, I need to follow this suggestion and perform a new search with the revised query. This will gather the predictive information the user is likely looking for.\n",
      "   Action: SEARCH\n",
      "   Justification: The first search failed because the query was flawed. I will now use the refined query \"AI predictions and trends for 2025\" as suggested by the search agent to gather relevant information about what experts expect to see in the field of AI in the near future.\n",

      "\n",
      "💭 Step 3: Reasoning\n",
      "   Thought: I have attempted two searches so far, and both have failed to return results. The first search was too specific about \"developments\" in the future. The second, more reasonable search for \"predictions and trends for AI in 2025\" also failed, which the agent noted might be a temporary issue. The agent suggested a broader search for \"future of AI\". This is a logical next step to gather some relevant information, as it's a broader topic that is more likely to yield results which can then be analyzed for trends relevant to 2025. I still have no information to answer the user's query, so another search is necessary.\n",

The search agent suggested a broader query, \"future of AI,\" which is a logical next step to gather relevant information to answer the user's question about AI in 2025.

Each attempt has failed, and the agent has explicitly stated that there might be an issue with the search tool itself. Since the only available tool capable of answering this query is not functioning, I cannot gather the necessary information. Further attempts to use the search tool are unlikely to succeed. Therefore, I must conclude the process and inform the user about the inability to retrieve the information due to a technical issue.\n",

      "*   **Blockchain Technology:** All transactions are recorded on a public, distributed ledger called the blockchain. This technology ensures transparency and security, as every transaction is permanent and visible to everyone on the network.\n",
